## **💰 ENHANCED ECONOMIC MODEL VERIFIED**

### **Creator Incentive Distribution (3x Improvement):**
```
Graduation Amount: 116,589 CORE (~$50k at $1/CORE)

New Distribution (v2.2.0):
  💧 Liquidity (50%): 58,294.5 CORE
  👤 Creator (30%):   34,976.7 CORE ← 3x BETTER!
  🏛️  Treasury (20%):  23,317.8 CORE

Old Distribution (v1.x):
  💧 Liquidity (70%): 81,612.3 CORE
  👤 Creator (10%):   11,658.9 CORE ← INFERIOR
  🏛️  Treasury (20%):  23,317.8 CORE

Improvement: 34,976.7 / 11,658.9 = 3.0x better! 🚀
```
