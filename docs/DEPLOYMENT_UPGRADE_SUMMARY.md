# Bonding Curve Fixes - Deployment Upgrade Summary

## 🎯 **CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The bonding curve pricing issues were caused by a critical bug in `BondingCurve.sol`:

```solidity
// BROKEN CODE in sellTokens() function:
totalCoreRaised -= (coreToReceive + fee);  // ❌ THIS CORRUPTED STATE!
```

**Impact**: This made `totalCoreRaised` decrease during sells, breaking graduation calculations and price discovery.

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Added New State Variable**
```solidity
uint256 public currentCoreReserves;   // Tracks actual CORE balance (can decrease)
```

### 2. **Fixed State Management**
```solidity
// ✅ FIXED sellTokens():
currentCoreReserves -= (coreToReceive + fee);  // Only reduce actual balance
// totalCoreRaised stays unchanged (cumulative)

// ✅ UPDATED buyTokens():
totalCoreRaised += msg.value;        // Cumulative (never decreases)
currentCoreReserves += msg.value;    // Current balance (can decrease)
```

### 3. **Fixed Graduation Logic**
- Uses `totalCoreRaised` for graduation checks (reliable)
- Uses `currentCoreReserves` for liquidity distribution

### 4. **Added State Protection**
- `_validateState()` prevents future corruption
- `getDetailedState()` for enhanced monitoring

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION COMPLETED**

**Tests Created:**
- `test/BondingCurveMathIssues.test.ts` - Demonstrates the issues
- `test/BondingCurveFixedTests.test.ts` - Verifies fixes work

**Test Results:**
```
✅ totalCoreRaised never decreases during sells
✅ Prices grow predictably with demand  
✅ Graduation state remains consistent
✅ State variables work as intended
✅ All critical fixes verified
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT READY**

### **Upgrade Script Created**: `scripts/upgrade-bonding-curve-fixes.ts`

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Deploys new BondingCurve implementation with fixes
2. ✅ Updates CoinFactory to use new implementation  
3. ✅ Analyzes existing bonding curves for migration
4. ✅ Provides detailed migration instructions
5. ✅ Verifies the deployment

### **Run the Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy the fixes (update ADDRESSES in script first)
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-bonding-curve-fixes.ts --network <your-network>
```

## 📋 **POST-DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Manual Initialization Required**
For existing bonding curves with CORE balances, you need to initialize `currentCoreReserves`:

```solidity
// For each existing bonding curve:
currentCoreReserves = contractBalance; // Set to actual CORE balance
```

### **2. Verification Steps**
1. Create a new token (should use fixed implementation)
2. Test buy operations (prices should increase monotonically)
3. Test sell operations (totalCoreRaised should stay constant)
4. Test graduation (should work reliably)

### **3. Monitor with Enhanced Functions**
Use `getDetailedState()` for debugging:
```solidity
(
  uint256 currentPrice,
  uint256 totalRaised,      // Never decreases
  uint256 currentReserves,  // Can decrease
  uint256 tokensSoldAmount,
  bool isGraduated,
  uint256 graduationProgress,
  uint256 graduationThreshold
) = bondingCurve.getDetailedState();
```

## 🎉 **IMPACT OF FIXES**

### **Before (Broken)**
- ❌ Prices stagnated or became inconsistent
- ❌ Graduation progress could go backwards  
- ❌ State corruption broke tokenomics
- ❌ Platform economics fundamentally broken

### **After (Fixed)**
- ✅ Prices grow consistently with buy demand
- ✅ Graduation progress never goes backwards
- ✅ State remains mathematically consistent
- ✅ Platform tokenomics work as designed
- ✅ Reliable, predictable price discovery

## 📊 **Sample Evidence**

From test verification:
```
Before sell: Total raised = 1000.0 CORE
After sell:  Total raised = 1000.0 CORE  ← STAYS CONSTANT! ✅

Price progression: 
0.0001 → 0.000100025... → 0.000100050... ← INCREASES! ✅

Graduation: Still graduated after sells ← CONSISTENT! ✅
```

## 🔒 **Contract Security**

**State Invariants Added:**
- `totalCoreRaised >= currentCoreReserves` (always)
- Graduated tokens maintain `totalCoreRaised >= threshold`
- Contract balance consistency checks

**Migration Safety:**
- New implementation is backward compatible
- Existing state preserved
- Only adds new functionality
